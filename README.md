# Hi, I'm Colton! Welcome to my humble abode.
I'm a web developer with a focus on frontend developement using React. I've been in the software development realm since I was in middle school, but didn't take it much of any where. I mainly made small scripts to automate stuff using Python, modded stuff for Call of Duty and Minecraft, messed around with Unity, and used made some apps to help me study algebra. In March of 2020, a friend of mine showed me an app he was making with React Native and it blew me away. I didn't realize how accessible it was to make mobile or robust web apps. I then started researching, dove head first into React, quickly realized I definitely don't know enough about HTML/CSS/JS, so I took a few steps back to learn the fundamentals. After just a month I realized I thoroughly enjoy the entire development process, especially when I design something in Figma and bring it to life.

### üìï [My Dev Blog][blog]
I document a decent chunk of my development journey here. It's mainly explaining what I'm working on, the struggles I come across and how I overcome them (some times in detail so that others don't make the same mistakes I make). I also talk about the next thing I'm interested in and wanting to work on.
